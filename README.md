# Basic Statistics for Data Science
Basic statistics example for Data Science using two sample independent T-test

## Overview
The experiment was carried out by comparing the original newsletter which was named product A and product B which contained some changes in the language and layout of the newsletter. Both newsletters have the same color, and topic. Their goal here is to check which newsletter brings higher traffic to the website, namely the conversion rate. This experiment was conducted for 30 days to monitor conversion rates in each newsletter. You as a data scientist get a job to test the results of these experiments.

The result i created is:
* H0 = Conversion Rate B <= Conversion Rate A
* H1 = Conversion Rate B > Conversion Rate A

P-value generated from my experience is 0.000363796012828762 which means that it is Sufficient to reject H0.
